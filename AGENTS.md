# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview

This repository is for a Dockerized Python web application named Job Logger.
The application provides a mobile-first web workflow for recording work time,
recording spoken job descriptions, reviewing recorded jobs, and creating
Autotask time entries after review and acceptance.

The application will be exposed through Cloudflare Tunnel using `cloudflared`.
The Docker deployment must include the Python web application, PostgreSQL, and
`cloudflared` when practical for local production deployment.

All design and implementation decisions must prioritize security first.

## Security Requirements

Security is the highest priority for this project.

Use both Cloudflare Access and application-level authentication.
Cloudflare Access protects the public hostname before traffic reaches the
application. The Python application must still enforce its own authenticated
server-side sessions and authorization checks.

Never rely on the mobile UI, browser state, or hidden form fields for security
decisions. The server must validate authentication, authorization, CSRF tokens,
job ownership, workflow status, timestamps, ticket numbers, ticket statuses, and
all submitted text.

Store all secrets outside source control. Autotask credentials, transcription
provider credentials, session secrets, database passwords, Cloudflare Tunnel
tokens, and API keys must come from environment variables, Docker secrets, or
another approved secret store.

Do not log secrets, session tokens, raw authentication headers, Cloudflare Access
JWTs, Autotask API credentials, transcription provider credentials, raw audio,
or other sensitive values.

Prefer secure defaults. Cookies must be HTTP-only, secure when served over HTTPS,
and SameSite-protected. Forms and state-changing requests must use CSRF
protection.

The application must maintain immutable audit events for important actions,
including job start, job end, description recording, transcription updates,
manual edits, review decisions, Autotask submission attempts, Autotask submission
success, Autotask submission failure, and authentication-sensitive events.

Raw audio must not be stored by default. If audio retention is ever added, it
must be explicit, configurable, documented, access-controlled, and auditable.

## Core Workflow

The mobile web page must provide a quick active-job workflow with these actions:

- Start work.
- End work.
- Record description.

Description recording is only available during an active job.

Recorded jobs follow this lifecycle:

1. A draft job is created when work starts.
2. The active job is ended by the user.
3. The job becomes available for review.
4. The review page allows the job to be fully edited before acceptance.
5. An accepted job creates an Autotask time entry.
6. Rejected, failed, or edited jobs remain available for audit history.

Jobs must never disappear silently. Destructive deletion should be avoided.
Prefer archived, rejected, superseded, or voided states with audit records.

## Time Rules

The application timezone is `America/Detroit` for all user-facing dates and
times. This is required so EST and EDT transitions are handled correctly.

Store timestamps in PostgreSQL in UTC. Convert timestamps to and from
`America/Detroit` at the application boundary for display, forms, reports, and
Autotask payload construction.

Job start times must round to the closest 15-minute interval.

Job end times and job duration must also round to 15-minute intervals.

Rounding behavior must be centralized in one tested time utility instead of
being duplicated across routes, templates, or Autotask integration code.

Daylight Saving Time edge cases must be considered when converting local times.

## Autotask Integration

Autotask time entries are created only after a job is reviewed and accepted.

The required Autotask time-entry fields for this application are:

- Ticket number.
- Summary notes.
- Ticket status.
- Date.
- Start time.
- End time.

Supported ticket status values are:

- In progress.
- Waiting customer.
- Waiting parts.
- Follow up.
- Complete.

Autotask submission must be idempotent. A retry must not create duplicate time
entries for the same accepted job.

Autotask API errors must be recorded clearly for review and troubleshooting
without exposing credentials or sensitive protocol details.

## Speech-to-Text Requirements

Speech-to-text transcription must be configurable by provider.

The application should define a provider interface so transcription backends can
be changed without rewriting the job workflow.

The translated speech-to-text description must populate the editable job
description used on the review page.

The review page must allow the transcribed description to be edited before the
job is accepted and submitted to Autotask.

Do not permanently store raw audio by default.

## Web Interface Requirements

The mobile interface must be optimized for quick use from a phone.

The standard review interface must work well on a full computer screen.

The review interface must allow full editing of reviewed jobs before acceptance,
including ticket number, summary notes, ticket status, date, start time, end
time, and the translated speech-to-text description.

All state-changing actions must be explicit and auditable.

Validation errors must be clear enough to fix the record without exposing
internal implementation details.

## Database Requirements

Use PostgreSQL for persistent storage.

Database schema changes must be tracked with migrations.

Important tables should include enough data to support job review, Autotask
idempotency, transcription status, and immutable audit history.

Database fields that represent timestamps must have clear UTC/local-time
handling documented in model comments, migration comments, and relevant utility
functions.

## Docker Requirements

The project must support Docker-based deployment.

Docker Compose should include the Python application, PostgreSQL, and
`cloudflared` when practical.

The application container should not run as root unless there is a specific,
documented reason.

Persistent PostgreSQL data must be stored in a Docker volume or another
documented persistent storage location.

Health checks should be added for services where practical.

## Python Standards

Python code must follow PEP 8, except the line-length rule may be relaxed when
longer lines make the code clearer.

Use type hints for application code whenever practical.

Use descriptive names for modules, classes, functions, variables, database
columns, environment variables, and configuration settings.

Avoid shortcuts that make the application harder to audit, test, or maintain.
Prefer complete, explicit code over clever or compressed code.

## Documentation And Code Remarks

All code must be clear to read and thoroughly documented.

Use docstrings to explain modules, classes, public functions, services, and
security-sensitive logic.

Use comments to explain important variables, configuration values, workflow
states, validation decisions, security decisions, database fields, and external
API payload fields.

Comments must explain why important decisions are made, not only repeat what the
next line of code does.

When adding new environment variables, database tables, models, service classes,
routes, templates, or external API fields, document their purpose.

## Changelog Requirements

Every project must include a `CHANGELOG.md`.

All recorded changes must be documented by version or by push if the project is
not versioned yet.

Changes that affect security, database schema, Autotask integration, speech to
text, Docker deployment, authentication, or audit logging must be called out
clearly.

## Development Process

Read this `AGENTS.md` before making changes.

If a request is unclear, ask questions before implementing.

Give feedback when a requested approach may create security, data integrity,
maintenance, or usability problems.

Do not assume implementation details that affect security, billing, data
retention, Autotask behavior, or workflow semantics without confirming them.

Before finishing implementation work, run relevant tests or explain why tests
could not be run.

Do not commit secrets, generated credentials, local environment files, database
data volumes, raw audio files, or private tunnel tokens.
